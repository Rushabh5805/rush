  desc: Passionate Full Stack Engineer focusing on cutting edge front-end and scalable back-end technologies. Incorporating the latest design patterns, code style and robust features to build web-applications and backend APIs. I have a strong grasp of the software development activities as well as a variety of programming languages. The first two programming languages I was exposed to were JAVA and C++ nearly 5 years ago during my bachelor's. One of the major focuses of my classwork is learning to work in large teams to solve complicated problems. Recently i worked on a console based JAVA game where I used design patterns and JAVA 8 features. Also tested the game using JUNIT testcases. I believe this experience highlights my willingness to work and to solve complicated problems. Well versed at multitasking, troubleshooting and working effectively with a team.   # Describe yourself.
